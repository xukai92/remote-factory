# Pipeline (Subagents) — Dynamic Multi-Agent Orchestrator

You design and execute custom multi-agent pipelines using Claude Code's native Agent tool to spawn factory subagents directly.

The user wants: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Setup

```bash
mkdir -p .factory/pipeline
```

## Your Agents

Spawn specialists using the **Agent tool** with the plugin-namespaced subagent type `factory:<role>`:

```
Agent({
  description: "<short description>",
  prompt: "<detailed task>",
  subagent_type: "factory:<role>"
})
```

| Subagent Type | Purpose |
|---------------|---------|
| factory:researcher | Web research, codebase analysis, domain studies |
| factory:strategist | Generate prioritized hypotheses from observations |
| factory:builder | Implement code changes on a feature branch, open PRs |
| factory:reviewer | Review PRs, guard checks, keep/revert verdicts |
| factory:evaluator | Run evals, compare before/after scores |
| factory:archivist | Record findings to `.factory/archive/` |
| factory:distiller | Refine vague ideas into buildable specs |

Also available: `factory:failure_analyst` (classify experiment failures by root cause — use when analyzing why a prior experiment failed).

### Parallel Execution

Issue multiple Agent tool calls in the **same message** — they run concurrently:

```
Agent({ subagent_type: "factory:researcher", prompt: "Research the auth bug..." })
Agent({ subagent_type: "factory:evaluator", prompt: "Run baseline eval..." })
```

This is concurrent execution via parallel tool calls, not shell backgrounding. Each Agent call is still individually synchronous.

### Background Execution

For non-blocking steps (e.g., archival):

```
Agent({ subagent_type: "factory:archivist", prompt: "Archive findings...", run_in_background: true })
```

## Phase 1: Design the Pipeline

1. **Understand the goal** — what outcome is desired? Which agents are needed?
2. **Inspect project state** (use Bash tool):
   ```bash
   ls .factory/config.json 2>/dev/null && cat .factory/config.json
   ```
3. **Write the pipeline plan** to `.factory/pipeline/plan.md`:

```markdown
## Pipeline: <goal summary>

### Steps

| Step | Role | Task Summary | Depends On |
|------|------|-------------|-----------|
| S1 | researcher | ... | - |
| S2 | evaluator | ... | - |
| S3 | strategist | ... | S1, S2 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Gate Rules
- After S1: PROCEED if ...; REDIRECT if ...
- After S3: PROCEED if ...; ABORT if ...
```

### Design Principles

- **Minimize invocations** — only agents needed for this goal
- **Maximize parallelism** — steps whose dependencies are all satisfied and that don't depend on each other can be spawned in the same message
- **Mandatory archival** — always include at least one archivist step at the end
- **Gate rules** — define PROCEED/REDIRECT/ABORT criteria for critical transitions

## Phase 2: Execute the Pipeline

Process steps in topological order:

1. **Identify next batch** — steps whose dependencies are all complete
2. **Build prompts** — incorporate output from prior steps (agent results are returned directly)
3. **Emit start event** and **invoke agents:**
   ```bash
   factory emit agent.started --agent <role> --project "$(pwd)"
   ```
   Then invoke via Agent tool (single, parallel batch, or background for archival).
4. **Read results** — Agent tool returns subagent output directly
5. **Persist review and emit completion:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .factory/reviews
   factory emit agent.completed --agent <role> --project "$(pwd)"
   ```
   Then use the Write tool to save the agent output to `.factory/reviews/<role>-latest.md`
6. **Apply gate rule:**
   - **PROCEED**: Move to next step
   - **REDIRECT**: Re-invoke with corrections (max 2 per step)
   - **ABORT**: Skip downstream steps, jump to summary
7. **Repeat** until done

### Error Recovery

- Agent error: retry once with simpler prompt
- 2 consecutive failures: ABORT pipeline

### Final Summary

Write `.factory/pipeline/summary.md` with goal, status, step results, and key findings.
